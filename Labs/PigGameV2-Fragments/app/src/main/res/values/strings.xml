        Enter the names of the players above.
        Players roll one die as many times as they wish or until they roll a 1. 
        Their score for the turn is the sum of their rolls unless they get a 1, then itâ€™s zero. 
        Players keep taking turns rolling until someone gets to 100. 
        If the player rolling first reaches 100, the second player may still take their turn. 
        The player with the highest score wins.
