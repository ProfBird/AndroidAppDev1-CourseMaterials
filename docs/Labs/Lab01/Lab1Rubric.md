**Criteria for coding style**

- Proper indentation is used.
- UI elements are named according to convention (example: incrementButton).
-  Java variables, constants, methods, and classes are named using descriptive names (Example: *int count*, not *int i*). 
- Unnecessary lines of code or files been removed (no commented out code or left-over boiler-plate).
- Explanatory comments are in the code (Coments that explain why you did what you did).
-  Variable names and methods use camel case (Example: camelCase).
- Constants are used where needed and named using ALL_CAPS.
- Classes are named using PascalCase (aka TitleCase).



**Programming "best practices"**

- Constatnts are useda for repeated literals.
- Variables are properly intialized.
- Variables are declared in the correct scope.
- Code is DRY (blocks of code are not duplicated.)
- Correct parameters are used in method declarations.
- Correct access level is used for instance variables, methods and classes (public, private, protected).
