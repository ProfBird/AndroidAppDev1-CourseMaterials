  CS235AM, Intermediate Mobile Application Development: Android

  ------

  ##Overview

  In this lab, you will get practice working with:

  - Themes

  - Menus

  - Settings 


  ##Part 1: Ch. 7 and 8 Exercises  

  For each of the exercises shown below, do one of the following:

  1. Follow all the steps shown in the book, build and ran the app. Experiement by changing some of the code to better understand how the app works.  

     OR

  2. Download the completed solution, build and run it. Read through the steps in the book and inspect the relevant code. Experiement by changing some of the code to better understand how the app works.

  **Do these exercises:**

  - Chapter 7: Themes and Styles
    - 7-1, Use built-in themes with the Tip Calculator
    - 7-2, Use styles on the Tip Calculator
    - 7-3, Modify a theme used by the Tip Calculator
  - Chapter 8: Menus and Settings
    - 8-1, Experiment with menus and settings on the Tip Calculator
    - 8-2, Work with menus on the Tip Calculator
    - 8-3, Work with preferences on the Tip Calculator

## Part 2: PIg Game  

**Group B: Little Pig – An 6-sided die**

- **Menu**

  Add a menu to the Pig game. The menu should have at least two items: 

  - *About*
     For now, you can just pop up a toast when the user selects “About”. (In a future lab, you will add code to display information about the app.) 
  - *Settings*
     Selecting the “Settings” item should launch a new *PreferenceActivity*. 

- **Settings**

  Add settings for: 

  - Enable AI mode (the user can play against the app)
  - Number of times the computer will roll
  - Max score before the computer ends it's turn

### Testing

I will test your app on a Pixel 2 emulator running an API 19 image.



##Submission

**Beta Version**

Post the following to the Beta + Code Review Forum:

1)    For part 1: A document containing screen-shots of the tutorial app with each screen-shot labeled. (Please use .docx or .pdf format.)

2)   For part 2: A zip file containing your app’s Android Studio project folder. (Make your solution smaller by deleting the *build* folder.)  
Or, better yet, a link to a repository containing your solution source code. (You can put the link on the same document with the screen-shots for part 1.)

3)   A copy of your lab instructions (so the lab partner who reviews your work will know what the requirements were for your app).  

**Production Version**

1. Items 1 and 2 above, but revised as needed.
2. The code review of your work (the one done by your lab partner) with the second column, *Release*, completed by you.
