You will just be changing what's there, not adding any        new widgets.</li>      <li>2-2, Create the Invoice Total app UI. You will:</li>      <ul>        <li>Add some TextView widgets</li>        <li>Add a EditText widget</li>        <li>Arrange the widgets and set some attributes.</li>      </ul>    </ul>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: Use the Empty Activity template,        and set the min API to 18 or higher.</i></div>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>    </div>    <ul>      <li>3-1, Finish the Invoice Total App. You will:</li>      <ul>        <li>Add an event handler for the EditText widget</li>        <li>Code to save the state of the app when it has been paused or stopped          and potentially destroyed</li>        <li>Add a launcher icon.</li>      </ul>    </ul>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: that for exercise 3-1, there is a        starter project in the source code provided by the publisher of the        textbook. It is identical to the finished version of 2-2, so you can        just use your completed exercise 2-2 instead of the starter project.</i></div>    <p><br>    </p>    <p>Upload a text file to the LMS in which you will report, for each exercise      above, whether you:</p>    <ol type="A">      <li>Followed all the steps shown in the book and successfully compiled and        ran the program (where applicable).</li>      <li>Loaded the completed solution, experimented with the code, and ran the        program (where applicable).</li>      <li>Read through the steps and inspected the relevant code listings        without writing or running a program.</li>      <li>Didn't do any of the above.</li>    </ol>    <h2><br>    </h2>    <h2>Part 2</h2>    <p>Create an app that counts the number of times a button is clicked and      that has a button that lets the user reset the count back to zero.</p>    <ol>      <li>Create a new Android app using the Empty Activity template. Accept all        the default settings.</li>      <li>Using the existing Constraint Layout, add two buttons and an        additional TextView to the XML file. (You can use either the designer or        directly edit the XML source)</li>      <ul>        <li>Set one Button's text to "Add One", and give it an appropriate id</li>        <li>Set the other Button's text to "Reset", and give it an appropriate          id</li>        <li>Give the existing TextView an appropriate id (it will be used to          display the count)</li>        <li>Set the new TextView's text property to "Count" (it will be used as          a label for the other TextView)</li>      </ul>      <li>Write the event handlers for the application. One of the event        handlers will contain code to increment a count and display it. The        other will contain code to reset the count back to zero and display it.      </li>      <ul>        <li>Add code to get references for the buttons and "Count" TextView</li>        <li>Implement the event handlers and set them to the appropriate widgets</li>      </ul>      <li>Optional, extra credit. Figure out how to store and retrieve the count        so that it isn't lost when the screen is rotated.</li>    </ol>    Zip the folder containing your project and upload it to the LMS.    <hr><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><img        alt="Creative Commons License"        style="border-width:0"        src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png"></a><br>    <span xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" property="dct:title">Android App      Development 1 Course Materials</span> by <a xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"      href="https://birdsbits.blog"      property="cc:attributionName"      rel="cc:attributionURL">Brian
