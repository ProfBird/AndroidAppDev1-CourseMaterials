You will need to install the following software:</p>    <ul>      <li> Java SE 8: If you don't already have the JDK installed, it will be        installed by Android Studio, or you can download it here:<a href="Consuming%20a%20web%20service"          target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a></li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li> Android Studio: You can download Android Studio, which includes the        Android SDK (for Windows or OS-X) here: <a href="Consuming%20a%20web%20service"          target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/</a>.        The Android Studio setup program will install everything you need to        develop Android applications: a version of the intelliJ IDE customized        for Android development, the Android SDK and Platform tools, an Android        emulator and system images.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Grade</h2>    <ul>      <li>Term project: 50%</li>      <li> Lab assignments: 50%</li>    </ul>    <p> There are 7 Lab assignments which constitute 50% of your grade. The last      lab assignment, lab 8, is optional extra credit. There is a term      programming project which comprises the other 50% of your grade. Your      grade is based on weighted percentages, not total points.</p>    <p> Grades are determined using a straight percentage (not a curve of any      kind): 90% is an A, 80% a B, 70% C, 67% C-/P, 60% D, 0-59% F/N. A minimum      of 97% is required for the grade of A+.</p>    <h2>Term Project</h2>    <p>Near the middle of the term you will write a proposal for an Android      application that will be your term project. The project will be due the      day scheduled for the final exam (there will not be a final exam). The      application must have the following: <br>      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least 5 kinds of widgets<br>      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An action bar with at least 2 items on the menu and an      up button on the second activity.<br>      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least 2 activities (the main activity should launch      a second activity)<br>      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different layouts for landscape and portrait      orientation (using fragments is optional)<br>      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persist activity state when rotating<br>      Your proposal should include at least a two paragraph description of the      app, a list of features. and simple UI diagrams for the two activities. </p>    <h2>Course Outline</h2>    Module 1    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td>Session</td>          <td>Topic</td>          <td>Do before class</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>1</td>          <td>Intro to mobile dev<br>            and Android dev tools</td>          <td> Skim Ch. 1: An Intro to Android and Android Studio,<br>            Read <a href="https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-android-programming-2nd-edition-detail"              target="_blank">Murach's
